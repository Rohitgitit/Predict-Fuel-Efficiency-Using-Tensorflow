# Predict-Fuel-Efficiency-Using-Tensorflow
This project implements a regression model to predict vehicle fuel efficiency based on features such as engine displacement, number of cylinders, and distance traveled. Using TensorFlow for model development, the dataset is preprocessed with Pandas and NumPy, and visualized with Matplotlib. Performance is evaluated with Scikit-learn metrics.
